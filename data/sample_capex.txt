Management describes capital expenditures (capex) as primarily focused on data center expansion, network upgrades, and office refurbishments. Capex is expected to remain within the companyâ€™s long-term target range as a percentage of revenue. They anticipate a modest sequential increase next quarter driven by infrastructure investments to support cloud growth. The company continues to prioritize ROI-positive projects and is deferring non-critical facilities spending. They expect full-year capex to be weighted toward the first half due to timing of vendor milestones. Management reiterated discipline around capital allocation and does not foresee unusual maintenance capex needs.
